                <p>After being cursed by a witch, this little boy's ghost got trapped inside a pumpking and left to sit
                    in a corner of the witch's house. One night this little boy came in your dreams asking for help and
                    that is where you have the chance to help him. In the dream he gave you the directions to the
                    witch's house and where his pumpkin jail is.</p>
                <p>You really want to help this little child to join the rest of his family and rest in peace but first
                    you have to go through a maze-like house, find the haunted pumpkin and leave without becoming one of
                    the permanent residents.</p>
                <p>You managed to get plasma cannons to fight the evil ghosts in the house and you can trap them as once
                    out of the house they can be released from their curses as well.</p>

                <h4>Structure</h4>
